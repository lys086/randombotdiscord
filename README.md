trash bot, use at your own risk, i dont recommend it
for friend or starter it might be a good bot, run it using pip install -r requirements.txt, and than py main.py, after putting your own token at main.py, it should run fine
this receives no more update, if discord.py updates and breaks it idc, do it on your own
